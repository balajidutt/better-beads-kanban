## Extension Test Suite

`npm test` runs the VS Code extension tests via `@vscode/test-cli`, which downloads a
real VS Code build and runs the suites under `out/test/suite/`.

`npm run verify` runs `tsc --noEmit`, then `eslint`, then the suite. Run
`npm run compile` separately for the production extension-host bundle. The test
prestep emits TypeScript and builds the webview; it does not exercise the shipped
esbuild extension-host bundle. Current lint/typechecking does not cover the
substantial vanilla-JavaScript UI. Report each evidence boundary rather than a
single undifferentiated “verified” result.

### Why `--user-data-dir` points outside the project

`.vscode-test.mjs` passes `--user-data-dir` at a hashed directory under the system temp
dir. That line is load-bearing: without it `npm test` cannot run from any git worktree.

VS Code opens its IPC socket inside the user-data dir, and macOS caps Unix domain socket
paths at 103 characters. Left alone, `@vscode/test-electron` puts that dir at
`<project>/.vscode-test/user-data`, so the socket path grows with the project path —
historical measurements were 86 characters from main and 129 from a worktree under
`.claude/worktrees/`. Past
the cap it fails with `listen EINVAL: invalid argument` before a single test runs,
preceded by `WARNING: IPC handle ... is longer than 103 chars`.

Passing `--user-data-dir` on the `npx vscode-test` command line does not work; the CLI
does not forward it to Electron. It has to be in `launchArgs`.

The hash keys the directory to the checkout, so two worktrees running tests at the same
time do not fight over one socket.

The downloaded VS Code build is a separate cache and still lives in each checkout's
`.vscode-test/`, so a fresh worktree pays a ~300 MB download on its first `npm test`.

### The bd fixture

`src/test/suite/daemonAdapter.test.ts` exercises `DaemonBeadsAdapter` against a real
`bd` CLI, so it needs a real database. The suite builds a throwaway one under the
OS temporary directory, outside the repository's shared backlog:

- `bd init --non-interactive --quiet --skip-agents --skip-hooks --prefix bktest`
  creates an embedded Dolt database.
  No external dolt server is required.
- A handful of issues are seeded directly through the CLI, spread across
  `open` / `in_progress` / `blocked` / `closed`, so the board assertions have data
  to check rather than short-circuiting on an empty board.
- The fixture is removed in `suiteTeardown`.

The fixture owns its temporary HOME/XDG/Git configuration, removes inherited
Git/Beads/Dolt routing, and checks CLI-reported context containment before seeding.
Subsequent commands explicitly target the fixture; routing is pinned to maintainer.
Subprocess time/output limits and environment restoration apply on teardown. Do
not replace this with repository-local initialization or direct database access.

If `bd` is not on `PATH` the whole suite skips rather than failing. That is what
keeps CI green, since the workflow does not install bd. Use the `skipIfNoBd` guard
for any new test that shells out to `bd`.

### A note on performance testing

This document previously described a SQLite-based performance harness
(`scripts/generate-test-db.js`, `scripts/benchmark-loading.js`). Both were removed:
bd 1.x dropped the SQLite backend entirely in favour of Dolt, so neither script
could produce a database the extension can read. Any future performance work needs
to build its fixtures through the `bd` CLI, as the test suite above now does.

## Writing a Test

**The suite uses Mocha's `tdd` interface: `suite()` and `test()`, with node's built-in
`assert`.** This is set by `ui: 'tdd'` in `.vscode-test.mjs` and `src/test/suite/index.ts`.

Do not use `describe()` / `it()` in these TDD suites. Node `assert` is the established
assertion convention; existing tests also import Sinon for mocks. Assertion and
mocking libraries do not determine how Mocha registers a suite. Inspect supported
runner options before selecting a subset; do not routinely edit the committed
test runner to filter tests.

Taken from `src/test/suite/messages.test.ts`:

```typescript
import * as assert from 'assert';
import { migrateUIState } from '../../types';

suite('migrateUIState', () => {
    test('Returns null/undefined/primitive inputs unchanged', () => {
        assert.strictEqual(migrateUIState(null), null);
        assert.strictEqual(migrateUIState(undefined), undefined);
        assert.strictEqual(migrateUIState(42), 42);
    });
});
```

Two mandatory rules from [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md#security-and-correctness):

- **Assert the specific constraint named in the test title.** `assert.ok(x || !x)`
  always passes and has shipped here before.
- **When testing "rejects X", confirm the rejection is for the right reason.** A Zod
  schema rejecting your input because you misspelled a required field name is not
  evidence that it rejects X.

## Integration Tests

Standalone scripts that validate adapter behaviour and data consistency against a
real `bd`, outside the VS Code host:

| Script | Purpose | Command |
| -------- | --------- | --------- |
| `test-adapter-integration.js` | Test DaemonBeadsAdapter field mapping | `npm run test:adapter` |
| `test-bd-cli.js` | Test bd CLI integration | `npm run test:bd-cli` |
| `test-message-validation.js` | Test Zod validation schemas | `npm run test:validation` |
| `test-field-mapping.js` | Test field mapping between adapters | `npm run test:field-mapping` |
| `test-round-trip.js` | Test data round-trip consistency | `npm run test:round-trip` |
| `test-all.js` | Run all integration tests | `npm run test:all` |

`test-bd-cli.js`, `test-adapter-integration.js` and `test-round-trip.js` each create a
throwaway bd workspace under the OS temp directory (`scripts/lib/bd-scratch-workspace.js`)
and run every command against it with `bd -C`. They never touch this repo's backlog, and
there is nothing to clean up afterwards. The helper refuses to run at all if `bd context`
does not resolve inside that temp directory.

The workspace is removed on exit, including on Ctrl-C. A `kill -9` does leave one behind:
these scripts are a straight line of synchronous `spawnSync` calls, so Node never reaches
the event loop to run a handler. The next run sweeps any `bbk-test-*` directory whose
owning process is gone, so a leak costs one stale directory rather than accumulating, and
running two of these scripts at once is safe.

Report the actual current run's counts, skips and failures; a historical count is
not a test result for a new checkout.

`npm run test:all` writes a `test-summary.md` at the repo root. That file is a local
artifact and is gitignored — do not commit it.

### Running Tests

```bash
npm run verify
npm run compile
npm test
npm run test:adapter
npm run test:all
npm run test:coverage
```

## Workflow Tooling

Use Node 22+ and Python 3.10+. Install the root and `.opencode/` dependencies from
their respective npm locks with `npm ci --ignore-scripts`. The tooling suites are
separate from the extension's Mocha suite:

```bash
npm run lint
npm test
npm run compile
npm run test:tooling
npm run test:tooling:python
./node_modules/.bin/vsce ls --no-dependencies
```

Compile after the application tests so package inspection sees the production
extension-host bundle. The locked VSCE binary is a development dependency; do not
substitute an implicit `npx` download. `tests/tooling/packaging.test.mjs` checks its
pin/integrity and the actual file listing, including workflow exclusions and
required extension assets/license. A filename count alone is not package proof.

Node tests use real plugin modules and JSONC/picomatch dependencies with a fake
OpenCode client, fake CLI queries, owned temporary worktrees, and fake release
commands. They cover reminder revision/delivery correlation, bounded subprocesses,
shared-main priming, release readiness/metadata/ancestry snapshots, output collision
refusal and account restoration. Python tests use disposable Git remotes and fake
GitHub responses to check workflow/ref/SHA/run-attempt evidence, helper receipts,
main selection, SSH alias constraints and absence of legacy Beads-state reads.
Fixture identities/hooks/credentials are synthetic; neither suite writes the real
backlog or publishes to GitHub. Read fixture implementations before extending them.

The tooling CI lane uses Node 22 on Ubuntu and macOS. That configured matrix is not
an observed cross-platform pass. The application matrix still includes Node 20;
the VSCE transitive development graph requires Node 22, so Node 20 application
results are not full-toolchain compatibility evidence. Native Windows orchestration
and interactive devcontainers are not qualified by these checks.

Mocked tests do not establish live OpenCode event delivery, provider routing,
installed-hook behavior, real Claude startup or release publication. Qualification
of those operations is manual and separately approved. Use actual sessions for the
baseline; the historical optional live-agent pilot is not a delivery prerequisite.
Keep one-off session plans, approval labels and local evidence artifacts out of
committed documentation.

## Visual Testing

Nothing in `npm test` renders the webview. Two interactive harnesses do:

| Harness | What it runs | Command |
| -------- | --------- | --------- |
| `scripts/visual-test-server.js` | Board and mock data in stock Chrome | `npm run test:visual-server` |
| `scripts/visual-test-harness.js` | The real extension inside VS Code | `node scripts/visual-test-harness.js [workspace] [--port=NNNN]` |

Reach for the standalone server first: it starts in seconds, serves on `localhost:3333`
with CDP on 9222, and Chrome DevTools MCP can drive it. Reach for the VS Code harness
when the host itself is the variable — theme variables, Electron rendering, the real
`bd` data path. For mutation tests, pass an approved isolated workspace, not this
repo's backlog or another real project's issues. Read the harness's fixture and
cleanup behavior before startup. `--dataset=showcase` on the standalone server
swaps the two adversarial title fixtures for ordinary screenshot content. Browser
mock evidence is not proof of actual Extension Host behavior.

### The standalone server duplicates the dialog markup

`generateHtml()` in `scripts/visual-test-server.js` carries its own copy of the edit
dialog rather than importing it from `src/webview.ts`. **Any markup change to that
dialog has to be made in both places**, or the harness keeps validating a DOM that no
longer ships. They have drifted before, silently: the server's copy had lost the
`maxlength` on `#editTitle`, `#editAssignee` and `#editExtRef`, and the `min` / `step`
on `#editEst`, so no input-constraint behaviour could be tested there.

Every control in the dialog carries an `id`, which makes the two copies cheap to
compare — extract the `<dialog id="detailDialog">…</dialog>` block from each and diff
the per-`id` attribute sets. Worth doing after any change to that markup.

### Driving a harness over CDP directly

Chrome DevTools MCP does not work against VS Code's Electron webviews at all —
Puppeteer's `Target.getDevToolsTarget` is unsupported there. It can also wedge against
the standalone server: once the Chrome it attached to exits, every call returns "The
selected page has been closed", `list_pages` included, and only restarting the MCP
server clears that.

Both cases have the same fallback. Node 22 exposes a global `WebSocket` and
`.node-version` pins 22, so raw CDP needs no dependency — though `engines.node` still
allows 20, where that global does not exist:

```js
const targets = await (await fetch('http://localhost:9222/json/list')).json();
const page = targets.find(t => t.type === 'page' && t.url.includes('localhost:3333'));
const ws = new WebSocket(page.webSocketDebuggerUrl);
// then Runtime.enable, and Runtime.evaluate with returnByValue: true
```

Four things that are easy to lose an hour to:

- **A VS Code webview's content sits in a nested iframe.** The target advertised as the
  webview is only the shell. Walk `Page.getFrameTree`, call `Page.createIsolatedWorld`
  on the child frame, and pass the returned `executionContextId` to `Runtime.evaluate`.
  Without it you get the shell's DOM and conclude the board is empty.
- **`Page.captureScreenshot` refuses on anything but a top-level target.** Screenshot
  the workbench page, not the webview frame.
- **Only one VS Code instance may run at a time.** `npm test` aborts with "currently
  only supported if no other instance of Code is running" while the harness is up. Stop
  the harness before running the suite, and give it `--port` so it does not collide with
  the standalone server on 9222.
- **Use `Input.dispatch*`, not `element.click()`.** Anything that depends on input
  modality — `:focus-visible` above all — answers differently for a scripted click than
  for a dispatched one. A synthetic click will tell you a focus ring does not exist when
  a real user sees it on every keyboard-driven open.

## The Extension Development Host

Workspace resolution, the file watchers and the webview are only reachable by
pressing F5 and driving the development host by hand — no automated suite
activates the extension. Three traps, each of which has already cost a debugging
session.

**You cannot open the F5 host's own workspace folder in the development host.**
Testing this repo against this repo does not work, so use another approved isolated
folder: a disposable Beads workspace for mutation tests, or a scratch directory
without a database for repository-discovery failure cases. Read-only inspection of
a real backlog requires its own scope; it is not permission to seed or clean it.

**`Add Folder to Workspace` keeps the extension host; `File > Open Folder`
restarts it.** The output channel is the tell — a restart prints a second
`[BeadsAdapter] Environment Versions` banner. This matters when testing how the
extension reacts to the workspace changing: if the host restarted, you tested
activation instead, and activation resolves correctly on its own.

**A board tab outlives a host restart, and the survivor is inert.** The tab stays
and keeps rendering its last cards, but nothing re-adopts it — there is no
`registerWebviewPanelSerializer`. Clicking Refresh logs nothing whatsoever,
because the message handler belonged to the host that went away. So before
concluding a change did nothing, check the log for a second banner and for a
matching `=== Opening Beads Kanban Board ===`; if that second line is missing you
are looking at a dead panel, not a bug. Tracked in the backlog.

## Manual QA Before a Release

The automated suites do not touch the webview. Walk this before cutting a release
(see [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md)); `scripts/seed-test-data.sh` gives you a
representative database only within an explicitly approved isolated fixture scope.

1. **Board load and filtering**
   - Board loads with the seeded dataset; column distribution looks right
     (Ready / In Progress / Blocked / Closed).
   - Search, Priority, Type and Status filters each narrow the board.
   - Status defaults to "Active" on a first load, so closed issues are hidden.
   - "Clear Filters" returns to that first-load default, not to all-checked.

2. **CRUD and status changes**
   - Create an issue through the dialog; edit an existing one through the same dialog.
   - In create mode, the relationship and comment sections stay disabled until the
     issue exists.
   - Update title, description, priority, type, assignee, estimate and dates.
   - Drag a card between columns and confirm the status actually changed in `bd show`.

3. **Table view**
   - Toggle between views; the same issues appear in each.
   - Sorting: single column by click, multi-column with Shift+click, default Updated desc.
   - Filtering by search, priority, type, status, assignee, labels.
   - Row click opens the detail dialog; clicking an ID copies it.
   - "Load More" pages in correctly.

4. **Tree view**
   - Hierarchy matches `bd list`'s tree output.
   - Filtering keeps matching issues visible with their ancestor chain dimmed as context.
   - Expansion state survives closing and reopening the panel.
   - Sibling sort (Updated / Priority / Title / Created) applies at every level.

5. **Graph view**
   - Renders dependency edges; nodes open the detail dialog.

6. **Relationships and labels**
   - Add and remove labels.
   - Add and remove parent-child and blocks dependencies.
   - `blocked_by` / `blocks` / `children` render correctly afterwards.

7. **Comments and markdown**
   - Add a comment containing markdown and a link; confirm it renders and is sanitized.
   - Oversized markdown is rejected with feedback rather than hanging the webview.

8. **Context actions**
   - "Add to Chat" and "Copy Context" both work end to end.
   - Large payloads are rejected with a clear message.

9. **Read-only mode**
   - Set `beadsKanban.readOnly` and confirm every mutation is blocked with feedback.

10. **CLI availability and lifecycle**
    - Verify the configured executable and CLI readiness/error paths.
    - Exercise refresh, workspace changes and disposal separately from host restart.
    - Do not substitute daemon-management commands for the CLI adapter's current probe.

11. **Error handling**
    - Open a folder with no `.beads` directory and confirm the error is actionable.
    - Point `beadsKanban.bdPath` at a nonexistent binary and confirm the failure is
      readable and does not leak internal paths.

## Continuous Improvement

### Future Optimizations

Virtual scrolling for very large columns is tracked as `bbk-jsi`: reduce DOM nodes so a
column can hold 1,000+ items without degrading. Incremental loading caps how many cards
are *loaded*, not how many end up in the DOM once they are.

### Testing Best Practices

1. **Test with realistic data**
   - Seed fixtures through the `bd` CLI so they match what the extension actually reads
   - Include dependencies, labels, and comments, not just bare issues

2. **Watch the pending count, not just the failure count**
   - A suite that skips is not a suite that passes
   - `daemonAdapter.test.ts` skips wholesale when `bd` is missing, which is easy to
     mistake for green

3. **Exercise both the schema and the CLI paths**
   - `messages.test.ts` / `security.test.ts` cover Zod validation in isolation
   - `daemonAdapter.test.ts` covers the round trip through the real `bd` binary
