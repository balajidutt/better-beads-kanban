/**
 * Standalone Visual Test Server for Beads Kanban
 *
 * Serves the Kanban board webview in a regular Chrome browser for visual testing
 * with Chrome DevTools MCP. Unlike the VS Code-based visual-test-harness.js,
 * this bypasses Electron entirely and runs in stock Chrome.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/visual-test-server.js [--port=3333] [--debug-port=9222] [--no-chrome] [--theme=dark|light]
 *
 * Options:
 *   --port=NNNN        HTTP server port (default: 3333)
 *   --debug-port=NNNN  Chrome remote debugging port (default: 9222)
 *   --no-chrome         Don't auto-launch Chrome (just start the HTTP server)
 *   --theme=dark|light  VS Code color theme to simulate (default: dark)
 *   --rebuild           Force rebuild webview bundle before serving
 *   --dataset=test|showcase
 *                       test (default) keeps the adversarial title fixtures;
 *                       showcase replaces them for screenshots
 *
 * How it works:
 *   1. Optionally rebuilds the webview bundle (npm run build-webview)
 *   2. Generates standalone HTML that mirrors the VS Code webview
 *   3. Injects a mock acquireVsCodeApi() that responds with mock board data
 *   4. Serves on http://localhost:<port>
 *   5. Launches Chrome with --remote-debugging-port for CDP access
 *
 * Routes:
 *   /           -> Standalone HTML with mock VS Code API + board.js
 *   /media/*    -> Static files from media/ directory
 *   /out/*      -> Bundled files from out/ directory
 *
 * Prerequisites:
 *   npm run build-webview  (or use --rebuild flag)
 *
 * Note: This script uses child_process.spawn (not exec) to launch Chrome.
 * All arguments are passed as array elements, not interpolated into a shell
 * string, so there is no command-injection risk. The only use of execFileSync
 * is for the hardcoded "npm run build-webview" command.
